hi we just like sitting and observing and getting our play time up for shits and giggles . generally dni if we don't know you + we don't share interests ; unless ur a sys / sourcemate , we'd probably be fine with interacting but we're socially awkward + anxious .

we're usually off tab doing something else .. or afk on our switch or smth .. whisper if u want us to see your message 4 sure ( if we have you friended dw we always check our personal chatlog , mainly 4 randos ! but we will check tab sooner if we see a whisper notification )

don't cuddle or hide unless c+h in name ; friends are okay 2 c+h regardless :3 we're going to ignore you if you have looking for rp on and we don't know you ; personal comfort , we don't rp & it makes us uncomfortable .

if you copy any of our skins we will hunt you for sport üòÅ inspo ok to a certain degree ?? we hide freely , if u mildly annoy us u will be hidden ; like if u boop us repeatedly or purposely try to cover us .

we're always somewhere around the heart lake , southwest of the library , if u wanna find us ! *occasionally* at the library or our island .

**dumb discourse stuff :** shut up about touch triggers and touch discomforts go outside ppl have boundaries & trauma ( as an autistic person uncomfortable with random touch , including in social games we play , u don't dictate what im uncomfortable with )
